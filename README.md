## Features

- üåå **Immersive Interaction:** Speak to a virtual Neil deGrasse Tyson, who responds with accurate, insightful, and often humorous commentary about science, the universe, and more.
- üß† **AI-Powered Responses:** Leverages large language models like Meta's Llama for dynamic and natural conversations.
- üöÄ **Real-Time Communication:** Displays user messages and responses in an intuitive chat interface.
- üîß **Configurable:** Easily switch AI models by updating the `SubmitInput` method.

## Technologies Used

- **Blazor Server** for creating the chat application's front-end.
- **C#** for back-end logic and API integrations.
- **Groq API** for connecting to AI models.
- **HTML/CSS** for the chat interface.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Users type their messages into the text area and press "Submit."
2. **AI Model Selection:** The app sends the user's message to the API, prefixed with an instruction to roleplay Neil deGrasse Tyson.
3. **API Communication:** A request is made to the Groq API using `ApiReaderService` to retrieve a response.
4. **Display Response:** The user request and the chatbot's completion is displayed similar to a text conversation.

## Getting Started

   ```

   On macOS/Linux:  
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. Run the application:  
   ```bash

   ```

### API Integration

The app connects to Groq's OpenAI-compatible API at `https://api.groq.com/`. Ensure you have a valid API key with access to the necessary endpoints.

## Future Enhancements
